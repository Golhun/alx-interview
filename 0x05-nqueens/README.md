# 0x05. N Queens Project

## Overview

The "0x05. N queens" project tackles the classic N queens problem using the backtracking algorithm. This problem involves placing N non-attacking queens on an NÃ—N chessboard, a well-known challenge in both computer science and mathematics. The goal of this project is to develop a deep understanding of backtracking algorithms and recursion, applying these concepts to implement an efficient solution in Python.

## Key Concepts

### Backtracking Algorithms
- **Purpose**: Explore all potential solutions to a problem and backtrack when a path does not lead to a solution.
- **Resource**: [Backtracking Introduction](https://example.com/backtracking-introduction)

### Recursion
- **Application**: Implement backtracking algorithms using recursive functions.
- **Resource**: [Recursion in Python](https://example.com/recursion-python)

### List Manipulations in Python
- **Usage**: Manipulate lists to store positions of queens on the chessboard.
- **Resource**: [Python Lists](https://example.com/python-lists)

### Python Command Line Arguments
- **Functionality**: Handle command-line arguments using the sys module.
- **Resource**: [Command Line Arguments in Python](https://example.com/command-line-arguments)

## Additional Resources
- **Mock Interview**: Prepare for technical interviews with mock sessions.

## Requirements

### General
- **Editors**: Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
- **Environment**: All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.4.3.
- **Code Style**: Code should conform to PEP 8 style (version 1.7.*).
- **Execution**: All files must be executable and begin with the shebang line `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- **Documentation**: A README.md file is mandatory at the root of the project folder.

## Setup and Execution

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Ensure all Python scripts are executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x *.py
   ```

3. Run the script with the appropriate number of queens:
   ```bash
   ./n_queens.py N
   ```
